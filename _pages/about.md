I am an Associate Professor at the Division of Systems and Control, Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University. My research interests lie in physics-informed machine learning and applications of machine learning in physics.

I am also the Director of Studies at our division, responsible for proposing staffing plans, and developing and ensuring the quality of our courses.
