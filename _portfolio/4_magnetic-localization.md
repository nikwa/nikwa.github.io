Localization is essential in a variety of applications such as navigation systems, aerospace and surface surveillance, robotics and animal migration studies to mention a few. There are many standard techniques available, where the most common ones are based on information from satellite or terrestrial radio beacons, radar networks or vision systems. In this work, an alternative technique is investigated.

The localization technique is based on one or more magnetometers measuring the induced magnetic field from a magnetic object. These measurements depend on the position and the magnetic signature of the object and can be described with models derived from the electromagnetic theory. One application that has been studied is traffic surveillance \[[J1,J2](#references)\], which has a high need for robust localization systems. By deploying one or more magnetometers in the vicinity of the traffic lane, vehicles can be detected and classified. These systems can be used for safety purposes, such as detecting wrong-way drivers on highways, as well as for statistical purposes by monitoring the traffic flow.

The technique can also be used to determine the position and the orientation of small magnets \[[P1,R1](#references)\]. By deploying four magnetometers on a surface, a small magnet can be localized within a few millimeters of accuracy. By mounting a magnet in a scalpel, the technique has been used to for creating a [workstation for digital pathology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeP0E83iPDI). The magnet can also be mounted in a water color brush to create a [digital painting station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rOyQuI76vE) for children, exhibited at science centers in Linköping and Norrköping.

During 2017 former colleagues at Linköping University, an entrepreneur and an investor, and I founded the company Stylaero AB based on the technology.
